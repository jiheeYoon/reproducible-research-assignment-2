-## Executive Summary
 +## Synopsis of Study Results
  
  This study U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's
  (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major
  storms and weather events in the United States, including when and
  where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries,
  and property damage.
  
 +Wind events, which include tornadoes and hurricanes, are by the far
 +the most harmful in aggregate, causing over 100,000 injuries and 90
 +deaths over the course of this study.  Though less frequent, severe
 +heat events have the highest incidence of deaths and injuries per
 +event.  This study finds that severe rain and wind events are by far
 +the most costly in terms of dollars spent to replace property and crop
 +damage.
